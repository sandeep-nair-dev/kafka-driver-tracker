# Kafka Driver Tracker (Demo Project)

This is a **demo project** built to explore and understand **Apache Kafka** using **Spring Boot**.

It simulates a simplified ride-sharing scenario where:
- A **producer service** sends real-time driver location updates.
- A **consumer service** receives and processes these updates.

The goal is to get hands-on experience with Kafka concepts such as:
- Producers and consumers
- Kafka topics and partitions
- Event-driven communication

This is not a production-ready system, but a learning-focused mini project to practice Kafka integration in a backend service environment.

## Status: In Progress ðŸš§

More documentation and features will be added as the project evolves.
